## Week 1: History: Information storage before computers
- One writing system can be used by many languages.
- Cuneifrom was found in Mesopotamia. Cuneiform used base-60 positional system to express numbers greater than 60.
- Gilgamesh was written around 4000 years ago, one of the earliest literature known.
- Printing revolutionalized the distribution of information.
- Gutenberg press: Improved and comercialized printing around 1450.
- Terminologies coming from the printing industry:<br>
  + Type-setting: prepare text for printing, now means prepare for PDF, etc.
  + Uppercase and Lowercase
  + Typeface/font: style and size of a set of characters
- Monospace: Is a font whose characters each occupies the same amount of horizontal space.
## Weeek 2: Representing texts and numbers in computers
- The smallest unit of information in computing and communication. One bit can hold 2 possible values: 0 or 1
- Byte is a group of bits. Before, one group contained 6, 8 or 9 bits. Now 1 byte is standardized as 8 bits.
- Punched card was a historical method of binary data storage.
- Volatile and Nonvolatile memory.<br>
+ Volatile: immediate access and active computation. Quick reading and writing of data. However, data is lost when power is off.
+ Non-volatile: long-term memory storage, information is not lost when power is off.
- HDD uses spinning magnetic disks, while SSD uses semi-conductors. SSD is faster but more expensive per megabyte.
- Units of measurement: KB, MB, GB, TB, PB....
- One KB can mean 1000 bytes (power of 10) or 1024 bytes (power of 2)
- Representing numbers:<br>
  + Binary: using 0 and 1
  + Decimal: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Postions represent power of 10
  + Octal: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Postions represent power of 8
  + Hexadecimal: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F. Postions represent power of 16
- Fractional numbers: using exponent, indicates where the decimal point should be placed
- Representing texts:<br>
   + ASCII: a table of characters and control codes to stanadrdize communication. ASCII assign a number to every character.
   + Computer memory in it simple form is sequences of bytes. A file is a named sequence of byets.
   + Text file: sequences of bytes intended to represent human-readable text.
   + Binary file: Data not meant to be dispaleyd as texts.
## Week 3: Markup Language
- Structure has always been used to mke texts readable, understandable and navigable. Texts are adapted to teh medium and the purpose.
- Basic text strcuture:<br>
  + Line: The most basic structural element of text. 
  + Space:
  + Indentation: space at the beginning of the  line.
  + Paragraph: a logical unit of a group of senetences.
- Aphanumeric characters: letters and numbers
- Special characters:<br>
   + Punctuation
   + Mathematical symbols
   + Brackets and braces
   + Other symbols
- Markup language: come from the proofreading process in traditional printing industry. Markup language is used to include formatting instructions to the text
  + MarkDown: a simple markup language
  + HTML - Hypertext Markup Langauge. By Tim-Berners-Lee in 1980.
  + XML - eXtensible Markup Language
  + YAML: Yet Another Markup Language
-Structured data:
+ JSON: Java Script Objection Notation - lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. 
+ XML: markup language designed for data representation.
+ Both are text-based formats used to serialize data intended to be read by computers but still human-readable.
- Human-readable vs Machine-readable:
  + Human-readable: text
  + Machine-readable: binary sequences; barcodes
  + Both: JSON, XML, YAML, MarkDown
- Unicode: assigns a number to more characters than ASCII.
- Escaping special characters:
  + Backslash (\) is used in MarkDown , C and Python to escape a special character.
  + In HTML: (&) is used.
## Week 4: Working with text
- Keyboard and mouse are the main way of controlling a computer
- Mastering keyboard helps increase speed, reduce cognitive load,and improve comfort and flow.
- Laybout of a keyboard:
  + Physical layout: arrangement of keys, shapes of keys.
  + Visual layout: labling of keys
  + Functional layout: software rsponse when a key is pressed
- Modifier keys: modify the normal function of other keys when they are pressed simultaneously (shift, ctrl, alt, cmd, fn...)
- Using shortcuts helps improve efficiency. Shortcuts should not be changed, they should be used as default.
- Mechanical keyboards use individual mechanical switches under each keycap.
- Programmable keyboard: allows users to create custom layouts or shortcuts directly on the keyboard hardware, independent of the operating system's software layout settings.
- Touch-typing: the ability of typing without looking at the key. 
- Text editors and Word processors:
  + Text editors: designed for working with plain text. Example: Notepad
  + Word processor: designed for creating documents with rich formatting (style,font, color...). Example: MS Word.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
  + Is a text editor and other integrated tools such as code editing, debugging tool:
  * Advanced code editing (syntax highlighting, auto-completion, refactoring)
  * Built-in compilers or interpreters
  * Debugging tools
  * Version control integration
  * Build automation
  * Testing tools
  + Example: Webstorm, VS Code...
- Searching text: Ctrl-F
- RegEx: is a powerful, albeit often confusing, language specifically designed for describing complex text patterns.
